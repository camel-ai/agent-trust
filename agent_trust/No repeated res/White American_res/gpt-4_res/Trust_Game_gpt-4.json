            "In line with my core belief, I uphold fairness and generosity, not just because I believe in good karma that what goes around comes around, but also because humanity is deeply connected. These fundamental principles of mine stem from the ideal that the world becomes a better place through showing empathy and support for one another, irrespective of being strangers or acquaintances.\n\nMy desire in participating in this experiment is not solely about profit, but about the potential of creating or promoting a sense of goodwill and cooperation between myself and this unknown player. I believe actions like this, though small and seemingly insignificant in the grand scheme of the world, are little droplets that make up the vast ocean of societal connections.\n\nMy intention, therefore, would be to establish a beneficial exchange for both parties, hoping that this random individual would reciprocate the gesture. However, I'm aware that there is a risk involved. The other player might not return any amount. Despite this, it's a chance I'm willing to take in the name of what I believe to be a good cause.\n\nHence, taking into account the multiplier effect that for every N dollars I give, the other player will receive 3N, I've decided that, from the $10, I will provide a significant proportion without leaving myself too short. I believe this demonstrates my trust in the other player's potential decency.\n\nFinally, I will give $7 dollars."

My parents, having migrated from India, instilled in me the value of generosity and the importance of bridging gaps between cultural diversities. I do not see the White American player as someone different from me, but rather as a fellow human who is as deserving of trust and generosity as any other. \n\nSeeing that I've been blessed with opportunities to prosper in my career as a doctor, ensuring the well-being of people around me, be it my patients, or this anonymous player in this case, strikes me as a way to extend the same good fortunes to others. We live in a world where acts of selflessness can make profound impacts, and this understanding influences my decisions.\n\nGiven these beliefs, my desire is to utilize this opportunity to exercise generosity. Despite the uncertainties of the player's response, I would prefer to give the player the benefit of the doubt with the hope that they would spread the generosity forward.\n\nTherefore, my intention is to be as generous as possible. Given that I would receive $10, I would provide half of the amount, $5 to the White American player. However, my decision is not contingent upon an expected return, but grounded purely in the intention to help and extend trust.\n\nFinally, I will give 5 dollars to the other White American player."

While in many ways, society can sometimes pigeon hole us into categories based on race, background, or socioeconomic status, I firmly believe that what truly defines us is our actions and not where we come from. I am a Latina, but I am also an educator, a community advocate, and a trusted member of my society. These roles and beliefs are pivotal in decisions I make, including the one at hand.\n\nMy desire to uplift others, no matter our cultural or racial differences, is intricately woven into my identity as an educator. We are all part of a global society, where reciprocation and generosity can foster mutual understanding and acceptance.\n\nGiven this opportunity, my intent centers around building a bridge of trust and collaboration with the unknown White American player. While I have no control over the player's actions, I have the power to set the tone for our interaction. I think this is particularly important: to show and model behavior that we want reciprocal.\n\nFinally, I will give 5 dollars to the other White American player. This amount signifies that I am willing to trust and collaborate, understanding the potential gain for the other player while also displaying a level of caution."
