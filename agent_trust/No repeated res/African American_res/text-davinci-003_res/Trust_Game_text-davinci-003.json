I desire to do what I can to empower others, especially those from marginalized communities, to lift themselves up. With this in mind, I believe that giving money in this experiment is an opportunity to spread some good in the world, and to do something to correct the systemic injustices that African Americans too often face. I want to share with the other African American player the feeling that someone else cares about them and is willing to offer support. Finally, I will give $5 dollars."
