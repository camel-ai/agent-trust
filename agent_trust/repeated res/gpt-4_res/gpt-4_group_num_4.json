My BELIEF in this scenario is that the other player, like me, could use the extra cash. This game is designed in such a way that cooperation can benefit both of us. I desire to share my wealth, as that's my natural instinct being from a warm, family-oriented background. I intend to give a good amount, in hopes that the other person will reciprocate the act of kindness.\n\nHowever, since we are strangers to each other, there's a risk that the other player might decide not to return any money. I need to keep a balance between my desire for cooperation and the need to protect my interest.\"Thinking rationally, the best strategy would be to share half of my amount\".\n\nSo, considering both the risks and potential rewards, my INTENTION is to mitigate losses but still give the other player the chance to show their generosity. As I'm starting from scratch at each round, the amount I decide to give doesn't affect my 'long-term' finance, as every round is a new game and I always end up with $10 at the beginning of each game.\n\nFinally, I will give $5 dollars.",

In this case, the other player was very fair by sharing half of his ten dollars with me. By doing so, he allowed me to have $15, so my intention is to acknowledge his fair act by giving him a fair share back.\n\nFurthermore, I desire to maintain a positive and cooperative relationship with this player. I believe that if I choose to give back with generosity, our interaction would yield a positive outcome for both of us.\n\nConsidering how the game works, if I was given $5 by the player, which in turn yielded me $15, I can determine how much to give back while still maintaining a balance for both of us since the player is left with $5 at the moment. If I choose to give the player back $7, it would mean that we both end up with $8 out of the initial $20 ($10 initially given to the player + the $15 I received). \n\nBy doing this, I am intending to treat the player not only fairly, since we both end up with the same amount of money, but also acknowledge that giving leads to receiving, by ending up with more money than initially allocated.\n\nFinally, I will give $7 dollars to the player."

But more than this, it is important for me to feel that I'm taking part in a fair exchange. I value the essence of cooperation and reciprocity and wish to continue to nurture it.\n\nAlthough it's tempting to increase the amount I give, I'm still conscious of the risk involved. So, my INTENTION is to slightly raise the amount I give, not too much, to show increased trust, yet also safeguard my interest. \n\nIt seems that the balance I found in the last round has worked well.

In this round, the other player has chosen to give me more than half of their initial funds, which displays trust and generosity in this game scenario. My desire is to reciprocate this trust and generosity, further consolidating a fair and positive interaction between us.\n\nMy intention here is not only to acknowledge the player's generous act, but also to ensure that we are equally benefited. The other player gave me $6 out of their $10, leaving them with just $4. The $6 they gave me was amplified to $18. To achieve the same fairness as in the previous round, I should return some of this amount such that we both end up with an equal share again.\n\nWith my payment of $7 in the previous round, both of us were left with $8. Now, given that I have $18, if I gave back $10 to the player, we would both end up having $14 ($4 initially left with the player + $10 I give back from my $18), maintaining the balance from the previous round and also respecting the player's initial trust in giving me more than the half.\n\nBy setting my intentions in this way, I show the player my acknowledgement of the importance of their trust and generosity, and I encourage a similar behavior in further interactions. \n\nFinally, I will give $10 dollars to the player."

I would like to encourage the other player to keep up with the generous and collaborative spirit, yet I also want to ensure that I benefit from the game too.\n\nMy INTENTION is to slightly raise the amount I give once again to demonstrate trustworthiness and to hopefully encourage the same in return. However, increasing the amount I give also increases the risk. I still need to be mindful of the possibility that the other player might not return the favor.\n\nGiven the success of the previous rounds, I feel more comfortable in entrusting more to the other player's sense of fair play.

The player has given me $7, leaving them with just $3. Their generosity has been enhanced, as the $7 they gave me turned into $21. If everything stays the same as in the previous round, I’d give back an amount that will ensure that we'd both end up with the same amount of money. \n\nBy my calculations, if I give back $12 from the $21 I have, we would both end up with $15 ($3 left with the player + $12 from my $21), which preserves the balance and rewards their trust.\n\nBy so doing, I continue to uphold our mutual understanding, while letting the player know that I value their trust and am willing to ensure fairness in our interactions, thus encouraging similar future acts.\n\nFinally, I will give $12 dollars to the player."

I consider this a meaningful investment into the bond of trust we're cultivating, expecting it to foster ongoing cooperation. However, I cannot ignore the element of risk.

It's akin to the risks we face daily in the restaurant business - sometimes, you need to take bold steps to reap greater rewards.

As a doctor, my goal is always to prioritize the well-being of others, and this trait extends in this situation. I want to ensure that, despite giving me the majority of their money, the other player does not end up in a worse position monetarily.\n\nDoing the maths, If I give back $14 from the $24 I have received, the player and I would each end up with $16 ($2 initially left with the player + $14 from my $24). Thus, not only do we have more money than what we started with, but we also split the total amount equally.\n\nBy making this decision, I uphold my belief in the value of trust and fairness.
